## 📌 Abstract

This repository presents a lightweight deep learning framework for automated PCB surface defect detection and intelligent severity grading. The proposed model redesigns the YOLOv8 backbone using depthwise separable convolutions to significantly reduce parameters while maintaining high detection accuracy.

A multi-stage pipeline integrates:

- Modified YOLOv8-MBNet detector
- Transformer-assisted severity reasoning
- Fuzzy logic-based grading system
- Edge-device deployment validation

The framework is optimized for real-time industrial inspection environments.

# 🏗 Proposed Architecture

## 🔹 Stage 1 – Lightweight Detection

The baseline YOLOv8 architecture was modified by:

- Replacing standard convolutions with Depthwise Separable Convolutions
- Optimizing C2f blocks
- Reducing redundant channel expansion
- Retaining SPPF for multi-scale context

# 📊 Detection Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Parameters | **1.15M** |
| GFLOPs | **5.2** |
| mAP@0.5 | **98.6%** |
| Precision | 97.4% |
| Recall | 97.0% |

✔ ~60% parameter reduction compared to baseline  
✔ Near-baseline detection accuracy

# 📈 Precision–Recall Analysis

![PR Curve](images/pr_curve.png)

All defect classes achieve near-perfect recall with high precision, resulting in 0.986 mAP@0.5.

# 📊 Confusion Matrix

![Confusion Matrix](images/confusion_matrix.png)

The confusion matrix demonstrates strong class separation with minimal misclassification between structurally similar defect categories.

---

# 🧠 Stage 2 – Severity Estimation

A lightweight transformer-based MobileViT-XS model was used for defect severity regression.

Severity score formulation:

S = α P_class + β A_norm

This enables contextual reasoning beyond bounding box detection.

---

# 🏭 Stage 3 – Fuzzy Logic Grading

Severity scores are mapped into qualitative grades:

- Grade A – Low Severity  
- Grade B – Moderate Severity  
- Grade C – Critical  

This improves industrial interpretability.
